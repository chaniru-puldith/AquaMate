      'Arowanas, also known as dragon fish, are a species of fish that are part of the ancient family of osteoglossidae. They inhabit the inland waters of South America, Southeast Asia, and Australia. Arowanas have elongated bodies covered with large scales and a distinct pair of barbells protruding from the tip of their lower jaw. They are highly predatory fish that you\'ll often see elegantly patrolling the surface of the water.\n\nArowanas can live over twenty years in captivity. They can grow up to 3 feet in length in their natural environment. The most common types of arowana kept in aquariums include the Silver Arowana and the Black Arowana.\n\nRemember, keeping an arowana is a long-term commitment. They require optimal care to flourish, including a suitable tank setup and a specific diet. They are not recommended for beginners due to their care requirements. But with proper care and attention, they can be a fascinating addition to your aquarium. Enjoy your journey into the world of Arowanas! üê†',
